# Income

Money is a means to an end, it's what we use to pay for the lifestyle we have/want. Getting money, or establishing an income, is one of the most important tasks one has to accomplish before they can truly establish themselves in the world. The unfortunate truth is that this world is sorely lacking in charity, and having been homeless myself I can attest to that fact. While you can just go out and find any job that will hire you, and most people do, this could severely limit your ability to achieve your goals and dreams as well as to affect positive change in the world. 

The two primary ways to make income are Active and Passive, the video below provides a good overview of these two methods of earning income:
